This directory contains line fits of the reduced Xsec
for the D(e,e'p)n experiment for thnq = 35 and 45 deg.

From the data and model fits, the ratio

R = (slope_model - slope_data) / slope_data_err

is defined.  This quantity is used to quantify the discrepancy
observed between data and model and is expressed in terms
of the number of standard deviations. This is to show that
the discrepancies are very unlikely to be due to statistical
fluctuations. For example a R= 7 sigma (where sigma=slope_data_err)
is very large discrepancy.

Hi Carlos

You are overthinking it. When you do the fit you get a certain value and an uncertainty for the slope.
You get the a similar value for the fit to the theory. Now the data are a statistical snapshot i.e. if
we would repeat this experiment many times we would get a sequence of values for the slope and we could
histogram these values and get a certain sigma for its width. As we cannot do these repeated experiment
we approximate the width of the distribution of slope values by the uncertainty we get from the fit.
If I now compare the difference in slopes between the fit to the data and  the fit to theory, I notice
that the difference is much larger than the uncertainty of the fitted slope. If we assume that the
distribution of fitted slopes is gaussian with the fitted uncertainty as sigma then we can estimate the
probability to observed a statistical fluctuation of a certain value. A natural unit for a deviation for
a gaussian is its sigma, you can calculate that the probability of observing a deviation of 1 sigma is about
37% and 3 sigma is about 1% and you can imagine how small the probability for 5 - 10 and even more sigmas is.
So just do the fits and get the values for the slope and their uncertainties. Then do the same for the calculations you have.

Kind regards
