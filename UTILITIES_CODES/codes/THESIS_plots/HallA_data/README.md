The theory momentum distributions Werner sent were given by M. Sargsian, who calculates K*f_rec_sig_cc1
slightly different from us.

Our theory momentum distributions are calculated by dividing the theoretical Xsec from M. Sargsian by
our version of K*f_rec*sig_cc1.

To check how large of a difference there is, do as follows:
red_sig_exp / red_sig_theory_sargsian
red_sig_theory / red_sig_theory_sargsian

The ratio is related to the ratio of the K*sig_cc1 as calculated by us and Misak, and allow us to determine 
how large of an effect is different in the calculations.
