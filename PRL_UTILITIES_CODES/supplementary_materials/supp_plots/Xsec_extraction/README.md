Fig 1: Missing Momentum Spectrum, bin-width = 40 MeV/c
Fig 2: Monte-Carlo Generated phase space 

This section will present the neutron missing momenta for each
of the three kinematic settings (80, 580 and 750 MeV/c) where
an overlap for the high missing momentum settings can be observed
and can be combined to improve statistics.

Each of the settings is integrated over all th_nq bins, which can
be selected specifically, as is presented in the letter.

Fig 2. shows the Monte-Carlo generated phase-space corresponding to the
kinematic settings of Fig 1. The experimental cross-section was
extracted by taking the ratio of the experimental yield (Fig 1.)
to the phase-space (Fig 2) for each kinematic bin.
