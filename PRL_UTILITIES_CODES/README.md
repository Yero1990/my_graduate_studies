#PRL UTILITIES CODES

Brief: This directory is aimed at facilitating the production of PRL plots for the deuteron experimet, as well as producting
other useful histograms that can be used as supplemental material. We also have the deuteron histogram object ROOTfiles, and plots
can be made easily. For example, plotting kinematics Q2, w, xBj, etc., for each of the deuteron momentum settings.

This directory contains:

1) various plotting utilities function to facilitate plotting histogram objects.
2) root_files (with histogram objects), plots, tables, relevant to the E12-10-003 code (Most likely to be used for thesis)
