The good agreement between	    			      31
the Hall A and C data at lower
$p_{\mathrm{r}}$ gives us
confidence in the measurements
made at higher missing momentum
settings for which no previous
data exist.

#made plots smaller to remove ~100 words per plot.
PRL plot 1: 308 -> 204 words = 104 words removed 

PRL plot 2: 243 -> 143 words = 100 words removed

--> total: 204 + 66 = 270 words removed.
