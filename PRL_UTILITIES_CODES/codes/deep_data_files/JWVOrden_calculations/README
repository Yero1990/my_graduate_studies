Hi Werner,
 
Attached is an Excel workbook with our calculations for the kinematics that you sent us. The “Nr” is the same as from your files,
but I have chosen to calculate some different kinematical variables than you have in your data files.  There are calculations for
the WJC 2, AV18 and CD Bonn wave functions. I also use two different form factors, GKex05 and AMT. Each case is calculated in both
PWBA and DWBA.  I was surprised that the effect of FSI in all cases is to decrease the size of the cross section. I have spent some
time checking the code to see if there is some problem causing this. This is the cause of my taking longer than promised.  So far
everything seems to check out, but I will continue to look at the code.
 
The decrease in cross section with the FSI may not be too surprising since for all of the kinematics the values of Tlab is well
above pion threshold.  The yellow highlighting denotes point where my code changes from using the Regge Fit of the helicity amplitudes
to using the SAID helicity amplitudes.MLet me know what you think and if you would like anything else.
In the mean time I will continue checking things and explore the effect of offshell effects.
 
Cheers,
Wally

The datafiles are given in 5-fold differential cross sections,
therefore, the reduced cross sections must be calculated from the
averaged kinematics
