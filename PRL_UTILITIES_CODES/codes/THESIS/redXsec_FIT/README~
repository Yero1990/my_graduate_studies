This directory contains line fits of the reduced Xsec
for the D(e,e'p)n experiment for thnq = 35 and 45 deg.

From the data and model fits, the ratio

R = (slope_model - slope_data) / slope_data_err

is defined.  This quantity is used to quantify the discrepancy
observed between data and model and is expressed in terms
of the number of standard deviations. This is to show that
the discrepancies are very unlikely to be due to statistical
fluctuations. For example a R= 7 sigma (where sigma=slope_data_err)
is very large discrepancy.
