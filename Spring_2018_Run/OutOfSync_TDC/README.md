Out-Of-Sync TDC Issue
----------------------

August 28, 2018

Brief:
During the Dec. 2017/Spring 2018 Run Period (4 Commissioning Exp. in Hall C
+ SIDIS) took place, TDC Slot 2 in crate 03 (HMS DC Crate) was determined to
be out-of-sync with the rest of the modules in that crate. At this point,
it was too late to fix, as it required an individual reference time in that module.
This issue had an impact on 4/12 plane residuals, as it caused smearing of the residuals
on the groups of wires affected. To alleviate this impact, it was decided to weight the
group of wires by a larger value than previously. The results are summarized in a latex
document present in this directory.
