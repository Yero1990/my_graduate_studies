\title{On the Out-of-Sync TDC Module on the HMS Chambers}

%*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
During the Fall-2017/Spring-2018 Hall C Commissioning Run Period, it was found that a particular TDC module in the HMS
Drift Chambers Crate (ROC03) was shifting the tdc times of the corresponding groups of wires being fed into it. At that time,
this did not seem to be a serious concern, as this could be fixed in software. There also seem to be no issues with the
residuals per wire after calibration. After the end of the Spring Run, I decided to look at the residuals per wire for a defocused
run in the HMS, and found certaing groups of wire residuals to be significantly smeared compared to adjacent groups of wires.
These were the same group of wires that exhibited the shift in time, which pointed to the same TDC module in ROC03, Slot 2.
In this document I discuss the following: \\
\\
1) the observations made that led to the determination of an out-of-sync TDC module \\
2) what was done to fix this problem in future experiments \\
3) how to minimize the impact on wire residuals

\newpage
The figure above is determinant in this study, as it shows the correlation of the reference time with the raw TDC time before and after applying the reference time correction.
As expected from a normal TDC, when tdc times are reference time subtracted, the correlation dissappears. However, in TDC Slot 2, the reference time and raw tdc time appear to be
correlated, which is an indication that its copy of the reference time is Out-of-Sync with the rest of the modules.

\section{Temporary Solution for the Out-Of-Sync TDC}
\indent As a temporary solution, it was decided that a copy of the reference time should be fed independently to the bad TDC module. This way, the TDC can synchronize with its own
reference time, as opposed to receiving an alternate copy from the trigger interface (TI) module. This modification was done on hardware on July 30, 2018. See Log Enrty \url{https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3583094}. A modification in software map was also necessary, as the TDC Slot 2 needed to point to the new reference time. This change affects the data replay from the
Spring Commissioning Run Period since during that time, TDC Slot 2 was pointing to a different reference time in the software. Therefore, if you have the most up-to-date copy of the
hallc replay analyzer, to replay data from the previous run period, make sure to load the correct map into the replay script being used. See Figure
