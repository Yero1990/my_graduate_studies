\chapter{PRELIMINARIES}		\label{preliminaries}

In this chapter we establish some notation and initial definitions;
for the most part we follow traditional references such as \cite{hu79}.

\section{Alphabets, Languages, and NFAs}

This section is quite brief.\footnote{Too brief, no doubt! \\}
% The FIU Graduate School wants multiple footnotes on the same
% page to be separated with double space; hence the "\\" above.

\subsection{What is nondeterminism?}

This one is even briefer.\footnote{We've got a lot of work to do\ldots}
