SYSTEMATICS STUDIES
*********************

Systematics studies are done on the deuteron data to determine which are the
systematic effects of most relevance and determine their associated systematics
uncertainties.  As a first step, the nominal cuts applied on both data and simc
are summarized, and used as a starting point to study the effects of cuts variations.

The nominal cuts applied to the data and simc are summarized, by plotting each of the histograms
on which a cut is made will all other cuts except that histogram cut. 

DATA/SIMC: 80 MeV
Model: Laget PWIA
Radiative effects (not corrected)

CUTS APPLIED: 
Em:        (-20, 40) MeV  
h_delta:   (-8,8)%  
e_delta:   (-10,22) 
ztar_diff: (-2,2) cm
Q2:        (4, 5) GeV2
theta_nq:  (35, 45) deg

#Cuts that Only Apply to data
SHMS Calorimeter EtotTrackNorm: (0.7, 5.)   
epCoinTime:                     (10.5, 14.5) ns

Each of the histograms were plotted with all the cuts above except its own cut.
