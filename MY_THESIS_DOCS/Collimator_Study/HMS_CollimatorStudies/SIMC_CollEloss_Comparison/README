*********************************************
HMS Collimator Eloss ON/OFF Comparison Plots
*********************************************

Cuts Made:  
HMS Delta: (-8,8)
SHMS Delta: (-10, 22)
W:          (0.85, 1.05)

Blue:  DATA/SIMC Ratio with HMS Collimator Eloss ON in SIMC
Red:   DATA/SIMC Ratio with HMS Collimator Eloss OFF in SIMC

The scales refer to the HMS Collimator Cuts made in Octagonal Shape;
No Scale --> No Collimator Cut
Scale 1 --> HMS Collimator Cut (Using Dimensions of Collimator)
Scale 0.95, 0.9, . . .---> HMS Collimator Cuts scaled. For example, 0.95 * collimator dimensions

These plots were mode for H(e,e'p) Run 3288 ONLY, as it is the closest in kinematics to D(e,e'p) 80 MeV
