 W Yield Comparisons

CUTS Applied: 
HMS Delta:  -8, 8
SHMS Delta: -10, 22
W:           0.85, 1.05


The W Yield Ratio between DATA/SIMC was plotted vs. SHMS 3/4 rate for various 
scales of HMS Collimator Cut.  

The plots at various collimator cuts in both DATA and SIMC were made for:

** Simulating Eloss In HMS Collimator

** NOT Simulating Eloss In HMS Collimator

An example of HMS Collimator for SIMC with / without Eloss is Shown, as well
as the data collimator for comparison.


Comments:
The Yield Ratio with Eloss in HMS Collimator shows an improvement of the
as now, the data point with NO collimator cut (RED) is closer to the rest 
of the data points.  

The reason is: Before SIMC simulated Eloss in the collimator, when a collimator
cut was placed, the data would lose events at the edge of the collimator while
SIMC would NOT, as it did not have events at the edge (no Eloss). Now, since
SIMC simulated Eloss at the collimator, when the collimator cut is placed, where
there were NO events before to Cut out, now there are events at the edge of the SIMC HMS
Collimator, resulting in a cut of those events in SIMC, so the DATA / SIMC Ratio increases
because SIMC Yield decreases with the collimator cut, as opposed to before.
