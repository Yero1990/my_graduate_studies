Here are some HC-LOG Entry references regarding the trigger set-up;

==12/08/2017==

The reference times for both the HMS and SHMS have been configured. We have configured
them to arrive at the TDC in the following order: 3/4, STOF, EL-REAL, EL-CLEAN. Cosmic runs
1547 (SHMS) and 1107 (HMS) inidicate the reference times are present and healthy.

Removed STOF from the HMS reference time.  All triggers except EL-REAL derive from 3/4

I have removed EL-CLEAN from both the HMS and SHMS reference time. Now, all that is present
in the reference time is an OR between 3/4 and EL-REAL. This was done as a result of STOF being
removed from the reference time during the spring 2018 commissioning run.

My Comments:
** For D2 Experiment, we had:  SHMS ref times: 3/4 or EL-REAL or EL-CLEAN (Mult == 3)
** T.coin.hT1_tdcMultiplicity== 1
** T.coin.hFADC_adcMult == 1
** T.coin.pT1_tdcMultiplicity == 3
** T.coin.pFADC_adcMult == 2

** T.coin.hDCREF1_tdcMult == 1
** T.coin.pDCREF1_tdcMult == 3
