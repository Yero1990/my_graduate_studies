Dear Carlos, \\
\newline
\noindent Congratulations on getting this together! I suspect you are going to need to tighten up the comments about the plots on page 4 to meet the PRL length limit, but in general it look good.
One important comment, the colors in the plots are impossible for someone who is red-green color blind.  (i.e. 8$\%$ of men and  $\sim$1$\%$ of women).
Try copying (using a color picker) the colors from this games made by our own Huey-Wen Lin et al.:\\
\newline

\newline
While they donâ€™t look red, green, blue to the color blind, they are three distinct shades which means everyone will be able to tell the three curves apart.
\newline
For the data points, please use two different shapes along with the color and that should be fine.
(e.g. circle and square)
\newline
Best Wishes,
Douglas

        0. KUDOS - What a great draft! It was hard work to find even one typo. \\
        \newline
        1.  GETTING INTO PRL - To increase the chance of getting accepted by PRL, you should add a few points to make a stronger case that
      	  this measurement is a qualitative advance over the Hall A data.  (You made that case already well wrt the Hall B data.) On page
	  2 when you compare the C measurements vs A/B, while you do give the specific Pmiss values, I would emphasize that you're "almost 
	  doubling the maximum Pmiss  compared to the Hall A measurement".  Also, you should mention in this same section the Hall A Q2 of 3.5
	  since that question is begged. (Unfortunately, the higher Q2 of the new C data sounds more like a quantitative than a qualitative
	  improvement, a fact echoed in your title.)  You could also try playing the "new facility" card,  adding one sentence to point out
	  that these are the first results using the new SHMS in Hall C. \\
          \newline
        2. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES - The uncertainty analysis on page 3 assumes that SIMC 1) reproduces all the data resolutions for both
      	 spectrometers, and 2) reproduces the acceptance for both spectrometers. That might have been ~true for Hall C in 2005. My impression
	 is that both are optimistic for the SHMS at this time.  This could add another few percent plus another few percent in quadrature to
	 your total systematic error. No shame in that for a commissioning experiment, especially one with even larger statistical errors. \\
         \newline
        3. MISSING ENERGY CUT QUESTIONS - I'd like some clarification on the missing energy (ME) cut for the larger Pmiss settings. This seems to
     	be an exclusivity cut to suppress inelasticities like n+pi0 for example. Carlos showed a lot of representative plots for the 80 MeV/c
	settings in his recent talk, and said on slide 29 the non-PID plots would be the same at higher Pmiss.  But the ME cut is not a PID cut
	per se, and would have to be adjusted for each range of Pmiss .  Can I see those ME plots for the higher Pmiss settings?
