Hi Carlos,

Thanks for the new draft of the manuscript.  I have a few comments, mostly minor.

Best wishes, Garth

Paper Title: I see that you changed the paper title.  While I generally like the 
new title better than the old one, I suggest to avoid qualitative descriptions 
in favor of quantitative ones.  Here, I suggest to replace "at Very High Missing 
Momenta" to "up to 1.0 GeV/c Missing Momentum".

Fig 2c: I see there is a small bump in the new data near pr=0.25 which disagrees 
by quite a few standard deviations with the Hall A data.  In general, the 
agreement between the two data sets is quite good, so it is a surprise to see a 
4sigma?? discrepancy there.  Any idea what this may be due to?
