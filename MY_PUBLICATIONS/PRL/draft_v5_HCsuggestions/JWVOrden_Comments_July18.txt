Hi All,
 
I have a few brief comments on this draft.

***being looked at by M. Sargsian
First, I would like to comment on the discussion of exchange currents (including what you refer to as the IC) on page 2.
If the NN model used to obtain the wave functions, and ideally the final state interactions us a derivative coupling of NNpi
coupling as in chiral EFT, there is an NN\pi\gamma contact interaction that also contributes to the exchange current with only
to form factors and on pion propagator. The estimate given for the pion-in-flight contribution assumes that all of the form
factors and propagators are evaluated a Q^2. This clearly can’t be true.

****DONE****
At the bottom of the first column of page 2 you have “At large Q^2, FSI are described by the Generalzed Eikonal Approximation…”.
This seems to imply that this is the only formulation of the problem that does so.  I would suggest that “are described by” be
replaced by something like “can be described by”.
************

*****DONE*****
On page 5 in the second full paragraph above the bottom of the first full column you mentioned the extraction of the     "genuine" (remove this word)
close approximation to the momentum distribution. You may tired of hearing this from me, but the momentum distribution is not a quantum mechanical
observable an will always be model dependent at some level.

*****DONE*****
It would probably be useful to state which parameterization of the electromagnetic form factors are used in all of the
calculations shown in the paper.
**************

Although I don’t think that this is something that should appear in this paper, I would be interested in knowing how
calculations with the GEA model and our model calculated with the same wave function and electromagnetic form factors differ.

*****DOVE******
Most importantly, you should note that I spell my last name with a capital V.

Cheers,

Hello all,

  And I completely agree with what Wally said. 

  For the future, if you plan to write a follow-up longer paper, a calculation that uses
  the same wave functions and form factors, and then different FSI (GEA and ours with the full,
  on-shell NN amplitude) would certainly be very interesting.

Best wishes,
Sabine
