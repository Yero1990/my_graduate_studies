Usage

To compare two documents simply run latexdiff in the command line like so:

latexdiff draft.tex revision.tex > diff.tex

where draft.tex and revision.tex are original and changed versions of your document, and diff.tex
is where the markup is stored. The above command provides latexdiff with the two comparison files
and the filename for the resulting marked .tex file. If the two input files you provide are valid
.tex files, the resulting diff.tex will also be a .tex file. This marked file can now be compiled
with your choice of TeX compiler (pdfLaTeX etc.).

Out of the box, any removed words are crossed out with a single line and colored red, whereas any
added words are underlined with a squiggle and colored blue. When equations are changed, additions
are marked with a blue font and removals are marked with a red.


------

If the LaTex file has other input .tex files, then these should be run independently
to produce diff_file1.tex, diff_file2.tex, ect.

Then, then, a copu of the original file should be made where these diff files are read in as input.

e.g.   cp draft.tex diff.tex,

latexdiff intro.tex intro_revision.tex > intro_diff.tex
latexdiff body.tex body_revision.tex > body_diff.tex


then on diff.tex:

\input {intro_diff.tex}
\input {body_diff.tex}
