Carlos,
         A few comments:

The first sentence in the abstract, I would suggest changing -Q2 to just Q2
and rewriting as this:

2H(e, e′p)n cross sections have been measured at 4-momentum transfers of Q2 = 4.5 ± 0.5
(GeV/c)2 over a range of neutron recoil momenta,pr, with pr reaching up to 1.0 GeV/c.

Replace "is" with "are"

"The dynamics in this short distance region are directly"

Remove "s" from "freedoms"

"explicit quark degrees of freedom"

For  the last sentence on the paper:

"In conclusion, additional measurements of the
2H(e, e′p)n would be required to reduce the statistical"


I would remove the "In conclusion" and join the sentence
to the rest of the preceding paragraph. 

Cheers,
             Mark
