Hi Werner,
Attached please see my comments on the draft.

Also the paragraph below I suggest to use instead of the one I suggested to 
remove in  the text.

The difference between the deuteron wave functions with CD-Bonn and Paris/AV18  potentials is 
how the NN potential is modeled based on the empirical NN scattering data.
The CD-Bonn model is based on the One-Boson-Exchange approach in which the 
Nucleon-Meson-Meson couplings are constrained to describe the NN scattering phase shifts
extracted from the date.  The interaction potential represents the static limit of 
this potential.  Paris and AV18 potentials are phenomenological in which the 
Yukawa type interaction is introduced and parameters are fitted to describe the 
same NN scattering phase-shifts.   The major difference between CD-Bonn and Paris/AV18 
potentials is that the former predicts much softer repulsive interaction at short distance which 
results in a less high momentum component in the deuteron wave function in the momentum space.

 
With Best Regards
Misak
