This .txt file has some initial ideas of what we want to include in the PRL
paper for the deutron.


Tables:

** Kinematic Systematics Table with relative uncertainties (these should be global, determined using Heep) 
   Eb, th_b, ph_b, E', th_e, phi_e, Pp, th_p, ph_p,

** Systematics on Yield correction factors (these should be presented per data set. 80, 580_set1, . . .)
   target boiling, proton absorption, tracking efficiencies, total live time,
   total BCM charge


Plots:

** Reduced Xsec vs. Pm for th_nq = 35, 45 and 65 deg
** % Deviation of all models and data relative to CD-Bonn FSI (data better matched this model)
**


Motivation:
- understand short range structure of deuteron or equivalently, the high momentum components of the deuteron wavefunction
- the most direct way is via the exclusive deuteron electro-disintegration at very high recoil neuteon momenta in PWIA kinematics
