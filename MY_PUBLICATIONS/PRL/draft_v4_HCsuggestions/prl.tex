\begin{abstract}
  New $^{2}\mathrm{H}(e,e'p)n$ cross sections have been measured at 4-momentum transfers of $Q^{2} = 4.5 \pm 0.5$ (GeV/c)$^{2}$
  reaching neutron recoil (missing) momenta up $p_{\mathrm{r}}\sim$ 1.01 GeV/c. The data have been obtained at fixed neutron recoil angles
$\theta_{nq} = 35^\circ$ and $45^\circ$  with respect to the 3-momentum
transfer $\vec q$. At these kinematic settings final state interactions (FSI),
meson exchange currents (MEC) and isobar configurations (IC) are expected to 
be suppressed and the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA) provides the
dominant cross section contribution. The new data are compared to recent
theoretical calculations where a significant disagreement at very high
missing momenta has been observed.
