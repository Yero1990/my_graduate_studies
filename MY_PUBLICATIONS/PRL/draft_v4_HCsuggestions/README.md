D. Mack
** Mention in abstract Hall C doubles the missing momentum from Hall A

** Mention Hall A data Q2 = 3.25 \pm 0.25 GeV^2

------------------------------------

D. Higinsbotham
** Change plots colors for color-blind people (mostly green-red)
To check it is ok for color blind people, set saturation to 0% to turn
colors to black and white. If we can distinguish, then it is ok.

** Change marker points to different shapes.
