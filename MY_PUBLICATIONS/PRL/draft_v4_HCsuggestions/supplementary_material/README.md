#SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
This directory contains tables and plots necessary for the
supplemental material of the PRL paper.

#The tables contain momentum distribution data, correction factors and
relative errors (sys_norm + sys_kin + stats)

#Plots that need to be made:

--------
spectrometer acceptance plots that show the HMS determined the SHMS acceptance.
DATA/SIMS comparisons for both HMS and SHMS of: delta vs. (xptar), delta vs. (yptar) for the 80 MeV setting only, integrated over all th_nq,
and all standard cuts applied.
--------

--------
Data Analysis Cuts (Data/SIMC), showing the cut region. Apply all cuts except the cut on the plot that is being shown. 

Emiss, HMS_Collimator, coin_time, Z_diff, calorimeter

Show these for the 80, 580 and 750 with the greatest statistics.
