HI Carlos,

the error in sig_red_exp is the same as sig_exp so we can remove that comment. The error delta_rho is the error of the averaged reduced cross section. 

Here some suggestions from Misak:

1) For 1 perhaps you can remove ref. 3 and the add the Science paper. 

2.)  We can only say something like: this new data set is ideal for testing fully relativistic deuteron models based on the light cone formalism.

I suggest to modify this as follows: 

The new  data set is ideal for testing fully relativistic deuteron models based on light-front or covariant formalisms.
In this respect the current EFT based models (ref.: P. Reinert, H. Krebs, and E. Epelbaum , Eur. Phys. J. A (2018) 54: 86, DOI 10.1140/epja/i2018-12516-4 ) are non-relativistic and might not have direct relevance to our data.

3) 3. I suggest to modify this sentence as follows: 
The suppres- sion of MEC can be understood from the fact that the estimated MEC scattering amplitude is proportional to (1 + Q2 /m2meson )−2 (1 + Q2 /Λ2 )−2 , where mmeson ≈ 0.71 GeV/c2 and Λ2 ∼ 0.8 − 1 (GeV/c)2 [8]

Modified version

The suppression of MEC can be understood from the fact that the estimated MEC scattering amplitude is proportional to (1 + Q2 /m2meson )−2 (1 + Q2 /Λ2 )−2 , where mmeson ≈ 0.71 GeV/c2 and Λ2 ∼ 0.8 − 1 (GeV/c)2 [8], this results in an additional 1/Q^4 suppression as compared to quasi elastic contribution.


kind regards

Werner
