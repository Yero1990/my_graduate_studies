*   PRL REVISION NOTES   *
**************************

Date: Sep 22, 2020

Brief: These notes are gathered from meeting with M. Jones / W. Boeglin
on the revision that needs to be done to the PRL manuscript.


1) Universality:  Only valid in PWIA.  We can put in the references.

2) M. Sargsian / Wally / Sabine use relativity in their calculations

3) We can add references of EMC-SRC, and a brief discussion


4) We can put addendum : systematic studies, [e.g. Nature 578 (2020) for example of addendum]
  We can add kinematics, show overlap of Precoil.  (We can add for all settings)
  

5) Only add insets for A) and B) of Fig 2

6) Add thesis to archive, and cite it from there.  

7) There is no contribution from the target walls after all the cuts are made.
   There should not be any yield below the deuteron missing energy peak.

8) We took a weighted average of the "reduced" cross sections (to clarify)

9) Another way to determine NN potential is using chiral perturbation theory (very low energy)
   (in response to pager5: EFT calculations question).

10) In the description of Fig2, if we attribute the different shapes of model/data to be due to
high momentum tails of the wavefunction, then this is a hint that the high momentum part has not
been accurately model. On the other hand, this can point to limits of the reaction mechanism in theory,
required a fully relativistic light-cone calculations. These are currently being done.

A more detailed studies requires a more detailed statistical precision.


** PUT THESIS ON ARCHIVE, PUT A FEW PLOTS ON THE ADDENDUM AND A REFERENCE TO THE THESIS.

** DETERMINE HOW MUCH DO THE WINDOWS CONTRIBUTE TO THE CROSS SECTION.

** REMOVER REF. 16-20, AND JUST REFERENCE THE THESIS


** PUT A RANGE OF RADIATIVE CORRECTION IN PRL.
