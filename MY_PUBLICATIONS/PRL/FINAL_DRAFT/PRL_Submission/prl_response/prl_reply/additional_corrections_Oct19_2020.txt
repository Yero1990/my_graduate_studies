Carlos and Werner,
      I have attached plots of the HMS and SHMS acceptance. For HMS ,  I selected thrown 
events which passed the collimator cut and the plot the ratio of events which passed all
the remaining apertures to the events which were thrown in the 2d yptar versus delta and
xptar versus delta. The ratio of acc/thrown = 98.6% for abs(delta)<8 && abs(yptari) < 30mr && abs(xptar) < 70mr.

For SHMS, the HMS defines the acceptance as roughly
abs(deltai)<4 && abs(yptar)<20 && abs(xptar) < 35
and within these constraints , the ratio of acc/thrown = 1.

So I would suggested that the systematic on the acceptance is 1.4% .
The main systematic on acceptance would be the software HMS collimator cut.
But we study that by scaling the cut by at 1, 0.9 and 0.8
and the results were consistent.

Cheers,
          Mark

NOTES
------------------------

Write is as a sentence for the response to the referee, stating the systematics of the acceptance is 1.4%


*** Inlcude 2.9% in the systematic error, as an upper limit. (integrated over all theta_nq)
--> Add quadrarically to the overall normalization uncertainty. 
**  Add 1.4% quadratically to the overall normalization error

--> remove "it is negligible" for the target endcaps in the supplementary.



** The target wall corrections over estimated cross sections by at most ~3%. The reason is that this ~3%
is the contribution from all neutron recoil angles, th_nq.

Software cuts systmeatics: remove the software cuts section

** Write in the response to the referee about the software cuts. remove barlow explanation

** to referee: We used the R. Barlow approach to determine the stability of the software analysis cuts. \cite[thesis]

---Cross Section Extraction----
** remove the units in counts / mC,  arb. units for both plots. 





collimator:
proton-Aluminum -->  proton-Tungsten

change Counts / mC ----> arb. units for all plots in supplemental
