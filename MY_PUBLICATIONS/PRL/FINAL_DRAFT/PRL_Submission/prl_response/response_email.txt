Report of Referee B -- LV16805/Yero
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This letter gives results on the Deuterium dissociation cross section,
and suggests that there may be a transition to a new regime at
transverse momenta of the order of 1 GeV. This is a very interesting
puzzle lying at the border of nuclear physics and QCD. I did not find
any flaw in the analysis presented, and recommend that this letter be
published in PRL.
