We report $^{2}$H$(e,e'p)n$ cross-section measurements at neutron recoil momenta up to $p_{\mathrm{r}}\sim$1 GeV/c which is almost double the
maximum $p_{\mathrm{r}}$ measured in a previous experiment. That experiment concluded that at neutron recoil angles
$35^{\circ}\leq \theta_{nq}\leq 45^{\circ}$, final state interactions (FSI) are reduced providing the plane wave impulse approximation
as the dominant contribution to the cross section. This experiment selects kinematics for small FSI and extends the neutron recoil
momentum beyond $\sim$550 MeV/c giving access to the short-range structure of the deuteron, a crucial step forward in the understanding the
nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interaction the sub-Fermi distances which is currently poorly understood.
