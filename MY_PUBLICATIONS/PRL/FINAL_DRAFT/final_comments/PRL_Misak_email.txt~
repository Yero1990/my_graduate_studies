Hi Carlos,
Attached is your draft of the paper with some suggestions

The text I suggest to add is marked by numbers 1,2 3 which are

1 However in difference to SRCs they were related mostly to the final state structure of nuclei
rather than to its initial state (see. e.g. Ref.\cite{Frankfurt:1999ik}).


2 
In addition to  PWIA picture,  the ejected nucleon undergoes  final state interaction  with the recoiling nucleon.  Other contributing  processes are the photon coupling to the exchanged mesons in the 
$pn$ system generating meson exchange currents (MEC) or photon exciting the bound nucleon into 
the resonating state (mainly $\Delta$ -isobar)  with subsequent $\Delta N\to NN$ rescattering 
referred to  as  isobar currents, (IC).


3.
Note that other meson exchange contributions that take place before the 
virtual photon interaction is included in the definition of the ground state wave function of 
the detueron.
