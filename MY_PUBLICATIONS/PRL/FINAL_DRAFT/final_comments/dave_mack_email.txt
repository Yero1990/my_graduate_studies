Carlos,

I went thru every word. Found a handful of very small things like number agreement.
ATTACHED (Don't miss the one tiny typo in the Biblography.) 

It's really a great paper.  There's a clear explanation of how these measurements
access the momentum distributions, a clear argument for why these results are forefront
and deserve publication in PRL, and even explanations for why various theoretical calculations
can give somewhat different results. 

congrats!

Dave
