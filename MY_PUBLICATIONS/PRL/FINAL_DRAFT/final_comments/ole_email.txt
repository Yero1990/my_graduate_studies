Hi Carlos,

nice paper. Looks like it has already been thoroughly edited. If I find
time (a challenge!) I'll try to read it before the 31st.

One small correction: Could you please give my name as "J.-O. Hansen"
instead of "O. Hansen". (There is already someone named "O. Hansen" in
(low-energy) nuclear physics.)

Also, I am curious how you produced the "marked" version? I know that MS
Word can do markup like this, but this PDF was generated with pdflatex,
so is there a cool TeX package that can do version differences?

Cheers,
Ole
