\begin{abstract}
  First results of cross section measurements of the $^{2}H(e,e'p)n$ reaction at 4-momentum transfers \\ 4 $\leq Q^{2}\leq$ 5 (GeV/c)$^{2}$  and
  neutron recoil momenta up to 1.18 GeV/c are presented. At the selected kinematics, Meson Exchange Currents (MEC) and Isobar
  Configurations (IC) are suppressed. Final State Interactions (FSI) have also been suppressed by choosing a kinematic region where the neutron recoil
  angle ($\theta_{nq}$) is between 35 and 45 degrees with respect to the 3-momentum transfer, $\vec{q}$. In this region, the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA) dominates and comparison
  to recent theoretical calculations show data to be sensitive to momentum distributions up to $\sim$ 700 MeV/c recoil momenta.
  
  
%  momentum distribution has been determined from measured for neutron recoil momenta up to 1.14 GeV/c.
  
  %An article usually includes an abstract, a concise summary of the work
%covered at length in the main body of the article. It is used for
%secondary publications and for information retrieval purposes.
%For PRL, the rule of thumb is that the abstract should be less than
%8 lines and the text (excluding authors, abstract but including tables,
%figures and references) should be less than 4 pages (leave about 20 lines
%empty on page 4) in two-column format.
%PRL and PRD papers have to have PACS (Phsyics and Astronomy Classification
%Scheme) numbers. Please see {\tt http://www.aip.org/pacs/} for the numbers
%relevant to your paper. A set of standard references can be found at the
%end of this example paper.
