DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

---FirstLook_DataSIMC_Deut----
Has DATA/SIMC comparisons right after the
experiment was taken on April 03, to April 09, 2018.


--SIMC_Deut_EstimationYield---
Has simulation results before the experiment was taken.
Yields and rates are estimated.


---Coin_Time_Module---
Has information relevant to the coincidence time module
implemented in hcana.  Documentation might be relevant to
include in thesis.


--HallC_12GeV_Trigger---
Has information relevant to the Hall C electronics/trigger
setup for single arm and coincidence. (See also HallC 2018 Collaboration Meeting
for nicer diagrams)

--Hodoscope_Calib_Doc---
Has information relevant to the new Hall C Hodoscope Calibration procedure
that was implemented in hallc_replay

--OutOfSync_TDC---
Has information relevant to a synchronization issue observed in HMS DC Crates
TDC which had a small impact on the TDC performance and affected the
residuals observed in some planes.


--ProtonAbsorption---
Has information relevant to the proton absorption studies done using H(e,e'p)
elastics. This proton absorption goes as a correction factor in the yield.
