DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

---FirstLook_DataSIMC_Deut----
Has DATA/SIMC comparisons right after the
experiment was taken on April 03, to April 09, 2018.


--SIMC_Deut_EstimationYield---
Has simulation results before the experiment was taken.
Yields and rates are estimated.


---Coin_Time_Module---
Has information relevant to the coincidence time module
implemented in hcana.  Documentation might be relevant to
include in thesis.


--HallC_12GeV_Trigger---
Has information relevant to the Hall C electronics/trigger
setup for single arm and coincidence. (See also HallC 2018 Collaboration Meeting
for nicer diagrams)

--Hodoscope_Calib_Doc---
Has information relevant to the new Hall C Hodoscope Calibration procedure
that was implemented in hallc_replay

--OutOfSync_TDC---
Has information relevant to a synchronization issue observed in HMS DC Crates
TDC which had a small impact on the TDC performance and affected the
residuals observed in some planes.


--ProtonAbsorption---
Has information relevant to the proton absorption studies done using H(e,e'p)
elastics. This proton absorption goes as a correction factor in the yield.


--BoilingStudies---
Has information relevant to the Boiling Studies done April 02, 2018. One
day prior to the start of our D(e,e'p)n experiment.  The targets analyzed
were Carbon (used as control), LH2 and LD2.


---Collimator_Study---
Has information relevant to the collimator studies done using H(e,e'p)
elastics. It shows the improvement on the hydrogen DATA/SIMC ratio when
the missing energy cut is made. It was decided to use this cut throughout
the anallysis.
