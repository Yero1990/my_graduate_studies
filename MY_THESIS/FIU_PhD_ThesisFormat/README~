FIU PhD Dissertation LaTeX Package
Geoffrey Smith
August 2011

The goal of the LaTeX class file "fiu.cls" is to make it easier
to format your dissertation as required by the FIU Graduate School.

As an illustration, this directory contains the files to generate a
skeletal FIU PhD dissertation: 

  thesis.tex		main file
  macros.tex		any macros that you wish to define
  prologue.tex		generates all the sections of the prologue
  abstract.tex          the text of the abstract
  chap?.tex		the various chapters of the dissertation
  epilogue.tex          generates the bibliography, appendices, and vita
  vita.tex              a sample vita
  automata.bib          a sample bibliography database, for bibtex
  thesis.pdf		the final PDF that gets created

Note how thesis.tex specifies information like the dissertation title,
degree field, and committee members; this information is used repeatedly
in automatically generating the title page, signature page, etc.

To compile the dissertation, creating thesis.pdf, use the commands:

  pdflatex thesis
  bibtex thesis
  pdflatex thesis
  pdflatex thesis

(As usual, latex must be run several times to get the cross-references right.)

Acknowlegments: "fiu.cls" was adapted from "cornell.cls", a LaTeX class file
for formatting Cornell University dissertations.

While this package has been used successfully by quite a few PhD students
in the School of Computing and Information Sciences, it is offered on an
"as is" basis, with no guarantees of its adequacy...
