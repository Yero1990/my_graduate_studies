To run this program, type:

(1) >> latexdiff original.tex revised.tex > diff.tex

where the original.tex is the original LaTex file, and the
revised.tex is the revised LaTex file.  The diff.tex file
is a latex file with the changes in a usful format.

Now run,

(2) >> pdflatex diff.tex

to produce an output diff.pdf file which contains the
old (crossed red) and revised (underline blue) changes.

In some cases, the .tex files may input other tex files via: \input input.tex

In this case, simply compare these input files separately using the command (1)
As an example,

(3)  >> latexdiff oldinput.tex newinput.tex > diffinput.tex

This diffinput.tex file can then be loaded in the diff.tex file, as one
would normally do:   \input diffinput.tex

Finally, run:

(4) >> pdflatex diff.tex

once again, with the diffinput.tex file loaded, and this should produce
a pdf with the marked revisions, including those from the input.
