1)  What curves should we include in the PRL?
CD-Bonn, WJC2, AV18,

** Take the ratio between the different formfactor and show how large are
the diffeerences.  Write a sentence on how large are the differences between
diff. fofa.


#In the Appendix: we can add a plot with all the different calculations
(What can we put)


2) How should we present the results of the linear fits?
These results show the number of standard deviations and
p-values describing the likelihood that the deviations in the slope
is a result of statistical fluctuations.

 ** Describe what was done.  Fit a line to the high momentum tail
 of the data to characterize the fall-off.

** different fall-off between data and dfferent models and quote
the minimum  Z-score and p-values.

WJC2 characterizes the fall-off, but does not reproduce the data.
