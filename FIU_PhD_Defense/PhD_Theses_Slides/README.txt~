1)  What curves should we include in the PRL?

2) If we include the same NN potential with different form factor
parametrizations, should we discuss these in detail? Or just
mention give a Reference. to the paper.

3) How should we present the results of the linear fits?
These results show the number of standard deviations and
p-values describing the likelihood that the deviations in the slope
is a result of statistical fluctuations.
